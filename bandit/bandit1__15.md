Login:
echo PASSWORD > X

sshpass -p $(cat X) ssh banditX@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
This command first saves the word PASSWORD into a file named X. Then, sshpass reads that password from the file ($(cat X)) and uses it to provide the password non-interactively when connecting via SSH. Finally, it connects to the remote server as user banditX on host bandit.labs.overthewire.org using port 2220.

lvl 1

used bash script
for i in $(ls); do file ./$i; done
hence found that -file07 has the password

lvl 

hints size 1033 bytes human readable
we can do it manually by using recursive listing
that is ls -R or ls -alR(gives all details of directories and files inside it)

find . -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
. stands for current directory
c stands for bytes

lvl 6

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
size id 33 bytes

cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

lvl 7

password in data.text next to the word millionth

cat data.txt | xxd -r > hexdump

file hexdump 
showed it is a gzip file

repeat this for every gz files
changed file name
mv hexdump hexdump.gz
extracted by using 
gzip -d hexdump.gz
it is extracted as hexdump

similarly for bz2 files
do all the same steps with some cavets
use 
bzip2 -d hexdump.bz2

similarly for tar files
use 
tar -xvf data5.bin

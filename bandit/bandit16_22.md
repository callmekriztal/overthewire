lvl 16

thhe password of 16 shoulld be submitted to a port 
on the localhost in thee rangge 31000 to 32000

out of them find the one speaks ssl which will give credentials 
others will  just send back we send

nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
PORT      STATE SERVICE

31046/tcp open  unknown
31518/tcp open  unknown
31691/tcp open  unknown
31790/tcp open  unknown
31960/tcp open  unknown

 nmap localhost -p 31046,31518,31691,31790,31960 -sV -T4

 PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
31046/tcp open  echo
31518/tcp open  ssl/echo
31691/tcp open  echo
31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown
31960/tcp open  echo

ie.315158 and 31790 speaks ssl

openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

openssl didn't worked sue to some  reasons

used 
ncat --ssl localhost 31790

entered the password 
gor private key 

loged to lvl 17
with 
ssh -i private.key  bandit17@bandit localhost -p 2220

lvl 17

we  have two files passwords.new and passwords.old
the pswd for next level is the only line which is different in both the files

used 
diff passwords.old passwords.new
got lvl 18 password

lvl 18

couldnt login 
did ssh command injection to find 

sshpass -p $(cat 18) ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ls

and read readme

sshpass -p $(cat 18) ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme

got the pswd  for 19 

lvl 19

We got a setuid file owned by bandit20.
Because of the s (setuid) permission, when we run ./bandit20-do, it executes with bandit20’s privileges instead of our own.

That’s why running 
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20 
lets us read the file, even though normally bandit19 could not.

Notice the s in the owner’s execute bit → setuid.

That means:

When bandit19 executes this file, it doesn’t run with bandit19’s privileges.

Instead, it runs with the owner’s privileges (bandit20).

So the program runs as if bandit20 is executing it.

lvl 20
my explanation 
Here in lvl 20 we have a suconnect file which is a setuid  
when executed with a port number it connects to the localhost

opened another terminal logged into 20
made a connection to localhost 2222
by
nc -lvp 2222

we did
./suconnect 2222

gave password in nc terminal 

got the password for 21th 

for refernce gpt version
In Bandit level 20, we use the suconnect binary, which connects to a port on localhost.
We need two terminals logged in as Bandit20.
In the first terminal, start a listener with:
nc -lvp 4242
pasted pass 20
Then in the second terminal run
./suconnect 4242
If the password is correct, the Bandit21 password will appear in the first terminal

note :
my doubt 
it is listening means it's the sever then normaly we give password through client,why server here
The binary suconnect is written so that it always acts like a client. It connects to a port you specify.

Since suconnect can’t be changed, we must create the server (listener) ourselves to accept its connection.

That’s why we run nc -lvp <port> — to make our terminal act as the server.

lvl 21

in this level we got a cron file 

stored in /etc/cron.d
we then got a cronjob_bandit22 file
cat it got a sh file
cat it
understood that pass for 22 is stored as somr /tmp/X

cat it 
got the  pass 

lvl 22

same

upto ssh files 
we prompted according to the sh script
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

gave 
myname=bandit23
echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
got a file call it Z
then as per the script
did 
cat /tmp/Z

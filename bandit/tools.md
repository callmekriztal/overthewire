nc(netcat)
It is a simple tool used to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP.

It can act like a client (connect to something) or a server (listen for connections).

-l → listen mode (act as a server).
-v → verbose, shows connection details.
-p <port> → choose which port to listen on.
